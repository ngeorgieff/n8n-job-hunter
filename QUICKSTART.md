#### 5.2 Configure Environment Variables

**For Docker:**

docker stop n8n

# Create environment file
cat > ~/.n8n/.env << 'EOF'
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your.email@example.com
USER_RESUME_TEXT="Your Name
Your Address
your.email@example.com

EXPERIENCE
- Your job experience here

SKILLS
- Your skills here"

USER_COVER_LETTER_TEMPLATE="Dear Hiring Manager,

I am interested in the position at your company.

Best regards,
Your Name"
EOF

# Restart with environment file
docker rm n8n
docker run -d \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  --env-file ~/.n8n/.env \
  n8nio/n8n
```

#### 5.3 Test the Workflow

1. **Configure search parameters:**
   - Open "Set Job Parameters" node
   - Set your desired:
     - keyword: e.g., "software engineer"
     - location: e.g., "San Francisco, CA"
     - country: e.g., "us"
     - maxResults: start with "10" for testing

2. **Test with Adzuna only (fastest):**
   - Right-click the 4 Apify nodes
   - Select "Disable" for each
   - This lets you test faster

3. **Execute workflow:**
   - Click "Execute Workflow" button
   - Watch it run (should take ~30 seconds)

4. **Verify results:**
   - Check Google Sheet for new jobs
   - Check your email for summary
   - Check execution log for errors

5. **Enable full workflow:**
   - Right-click the 4 Apify nodes
   - Select "Enable" for each
   - Run again (will take 5-10 minutes)

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "Unauthorized" errors
â†’ Check API keys are correct and have no extra spaces

### "Sheet not found" error
â†’ Verify sheet name is exactly "Jobs" and Sheet ID is correct

### "OAuth error" for Google
â†’ Make sure redirect URI in Google Cloud matches exactly what n8n shows

### No jobs found
â†’ Try broader search terms or different location

### Workflow hangs
â†’ Check Apify dashboard to see if runs are stuck

## Next Steps

After successful test:

1. **Activate scheduled runs:**
   - Toggle "Active" switch in workflow
   - It will now run daily automatically

2. **Customize your search:**
   - Adjust keyword and location
   - Modify maxResults (20-50 recommended)

3. **Update your resume:**
   - Edit `USER_RESUME_TEXT` environment variable
   - Make it detailed for better AI tailoring

4. **Monitor results:**
   - Check executions daily for first week
   - Review job quality
   - Adjust parameters as needed

## Cost Estimate

**Monthly costs with daily runs:**

| Service | Free Tier | Paid |
|---------|-----------|------|
| n8n (self-hosted) | Free | - |
| Apify | 100 runs/month | $49/month |
| Adzuna | 1,000 calls/month | Varies |
| OpenRouter | - | ~$10-30/month |
| Google Sheets | Free | - |
| Gmail | Free | - |

**Total: ~$50-80/month** for fully automated job search

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small:** Test with 10 results first, then scale up
2. **Monitor costs:** Check OpenRouter credits weekly
3. **Refine search:** Adjust keywords based on results
4. **Review quality:** Check jobs in sheet regularly
5. **Customize AI:** Update resume/cover letter for better results
